## Testing

### Improvements

A consistent issue throughout seemed to be revolving around accessibility. I targetted all the link elements and gave them discernible, unique and focusable link text. Lighthouse results after improvement:

<details><summary>Desktop results </summary>
<img src="docs/lighthouse/index.html.desktop-after.png">
<img src="docs/lighthouse/contact.html.desktop-after.png">

<details><summary>Mobile results.</summary>
<img src="docs/lighthouse/index.html.mobile.png">
<img src="docs/lighthouse/contact.html.mobile-after.png">
</details>
<br>

However, I found that when i resized the page for the index.html desktop page the best practices score dropped significantly
