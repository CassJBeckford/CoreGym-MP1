### Improvements

A consistent issue throughout seemed to be revolving around accessibility. I targetted all the link elements and gave them discernible, unique and focusable link text. I also changed all jpeg image documents to webp documents. Lighthouse results after improvement:

### Further testing 

This website was tested on:

- Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
- The website was tested on multiple devices. Laptop, Ipad, Iphone 11 and Iphone 12.
- Testing has been done to ensure all elements were linking correctly. 

### Known bugs 

- Nav bar doesn't close instantly after it's been used on mobile devices. 
- Phone number appears as blue before being tapped on mobile devices. 

### Fixed bugs 

- The Hero video only played in fullscreen on ios devices. Fixed by adding a 'playsinline' attribute.

### Development process

- I started the program and repository by using the [gitpod template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) provided by the Code Insitute.  
- Then I regularly staged my changes using the command `git add <filename>` and then committed the staged changes to my local repository using `git commit -m 'short descriptive message here'`. 
- Finally, I would push the commits from my local repository up to the Github repository using the command `git push`.
- With every push, Github automatically deploys my latest commit from the 'main' branch to the Github pages.

       2. The Core gym logo is a clickabke link that remains in the header of every page so the user can easily find their way to the home page.
       3. The about section is close to the top of the page, allowing for a near-immediate insight into what the gym is hoping to provide.
